               Welcome to the workroom, please watch your step.

   If you've found this, congratulations. Either you've found a link I left
somewhere for the Lua Archive, or you're here because you spotted my resume.

   Either way, this is my personal GitHub, and my archive for making sure I
do not lose important copies of files. Most of what you'll find here is my
FFXI .Lua files, for GearSwap(Windower) and LuAshitaCast(Ashita). For those
who have no idea what that is, think of them as high-speed command scripts.

   What you'll also find is my side projects, some of which are active, and
many of which are not. For one reason or another, I may put a project down
for months on end, and pick it up again semi-randomly many moons later. This
is the nature of my side projects, and they do not always have a 'point'.

  You will also find I do a lot of game-themed programming, because that is
what maintains my interest the best until a challenge presents itself-- at
which point, all bets are off until I have figured out the problem that
presented itself. That might mean this archive sits silent for months on
end, then suddenly comes alive again-- that is the nature of my hyper-focus.

      All of this said, welcome to the workroom, please enjoy your stay.

    For the curious, the characters are my name. (Yes, I am a tiny nerd.)
   I own cats (2) and play with fancy japanese slicing sticks. (Naginata.)
             Coffee keeps me awake. Curiosity keeps me going.
           Coding keep me awake late enough to need more coffee.
